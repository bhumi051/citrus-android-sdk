<h5>Introduction</h5>
___
* This document details the merchant's <b>Android App</b> integration with Citrus Payment gateway.There is a difference between <b>Normal(PG) Payment</b> and <b>Prepaid Payment</b>!
* <b>Normal</b> payment requires only <b>email</b> and <b>mobile</b>. Citrus User account will be created by only using email and mobile combination. We call it as <b><i>Bind</i></b>. Once user is Bind, card can be saved against his account, saved cards can be fetched against his account.
* <b>Prepaid</b> Payment requires <b>email</b> and <b>password</b>. Citrus User account will be created by using email and password combination. We call it prepaid account.

This is enhanced [version](docs/Version%20History.md) of SDK V2 wherein you can implement your App with features such as:

* Pay using Credit Card/Debit Card & Netbanking 
* Pay Using Citrus Cash - user can make a payment using Citrus Cash account if he has sufficient amount for payment. 
* Get Citrus Cash balance
* Load Money – money can be loaded to user’s account using CC/DC/NB option.
* Save Cards and Bank options to user account for faster checkout
* Fetch Saved cards of user
* Delete Cards
* Send Money
* Logout your user from App
* Withdraw your Money
